## STL (Standard Template Library) in C++ is a powerful library that provides a collection of template-based classes and functions to handle common data structures and algorithms. It simplifies programming by offering reusable components.

### Components of STL
STL is mainly divided into three parts:

### Containers

Used to store collections of data.
#### Examples:
###### Sequence Containers: vector, list, deque
###### Associative Containers: set, map, multiset, multimap
###### Unordered Containers: unordered_set, unordered_map
###### Algorithms

Predefined functions to perform operations like sorting, searching, etc.
Examples: sort(), binary_search(), find(), reverse()
Iterators

Used to traverse elements in containers.
Types: begin(), end(), rbegin(), rend()
